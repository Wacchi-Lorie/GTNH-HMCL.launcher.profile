## HMCL instance launch profile for GTNH
Hand-crafted GTNH launcher profile specially for HMCL

Notably HMCL's next version will solve issue of creating launch profile with modern java on 1.7.10

That [issue](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL/issues/2995) i've create

## Using this profile
* This profile is for [HMCL](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL) only, i won't answer any question about other launchers
* This profile is for GTNH with modern java only, modpack with java8 don't need this profile
* This profile is for client only, server side don't need HMCL or this profile
* Choose the correct profile, since GTNH has just released 2.6.0, betas or nightly versions between 2.5.1 and 2.6.0 won't be uploaded
* How to use:
  * Download GTNH MMC modern java versions from [here](https://downloads.gtnewhorizons.com/Multi_mc_downloads/), along with the corresponding [server](https://downloads.gtnewhorizons.com/ServerPacks/)(recommended)
  * create a folder (better if folder path containing ASCII glyphs only), create a directory in HMCL and choose the folder you make before![image](https://github.com/Wacchi-Lorie/GTNH-HMCL.launcher.profile/assets/57549294/bf7aa753-93a2-4fb7-b7f0-59c034240bec)
  * download the corresponding /version folder to the root folder you've just created
  * if you've done things right, open HMCL now and a instance like GTNH 2.6.0 would appear

  * extract /.minecraft/* from the zip file downloaded from GTNH to you folder
  * (if upgrated from older versions) add or delete mods you like, copy or override config of mods you added yourself...
  * modify the launcher settings, java must be jdk17-21

* you can verify hash of jar files if you are worried, i don't have that capability to inject something malicious though :P
